### Description

This project was an exercise in building a single page CRUD application. It's a Rails
application for the backend database, and uses jQuery and AJAX for the
frontend.  This project was my first experience writing a javascript-focused
application with heavy DOM manipulation using jQuery.

### Usage

* Create new ideas: Add a new idea to the list by using the form in the upper left hand
  corner.

* Change idea quality: Once an Idea is added to the list, use the
  thumbs-up/thumbs-down button to adjust the rating

* Delete ideas: To delete an idea, click the 'X' next to the idea. Careful
  though, that idea is gone forever.

* Edit ideas: To change the content of an idea, click the title or body and start
  editing! Changes will be saved automatically when you click away.

* Search: Start typing in the search box to filter the ideas list.

### To Do 
 
* Allow idea bodies longer than 100 characters
